# Dogs and Code Smells
Resources from my lightning talk "Why dogs make the best  programmers"

A discussion of the many similarities between dogs and good programming practices with clean code examples.

You'll find my slides from the talk as well as the [before](dogs_before.py) and [after](dogs_after.py) code snippets

A great resource which influenced this talk is [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells)
